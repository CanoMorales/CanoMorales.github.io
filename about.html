        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p> My name is Cano Morales and I'm a sophmore at The University of Rhode Island. Recently, I changed my major to Computer Science and I'm still trying to get <br> the hang of it.
           Currently I live in North Providence, Rhode Island which is convenient considering URI is a short ride down. Besided my interest in coding, I like to play soccer with my <br>friends and spend time with my family.
           I also enjoy playing video games with my brother and realize now that playing video games is what sparked my interest in Computer Science.
