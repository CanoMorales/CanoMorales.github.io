        <p>Welcome to Hungry Rams! In this game, my partner and I created a simulation app that is very similar to Uber eats or Door Dash. You start at the opening scene, and when you're ready to order, you click on "Start Order". From there, it'll take you to a page where you'll be able to select the restaurant that your craving for. After making your restaurant selection, you'll be able to choose numerous amount of menu items. At the bottom of the screen, there is a tally of the number of items you picked, accompanied by the calories and the price you owe. If you're ready, click on "pay" and sign with your signature; after that, you're all set and ready to go!</p>
